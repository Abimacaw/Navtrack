## How It Works 🛠️

1. **Location Tracking**:
   - The GPS module continuously retrieves location and speed data. 🛰️
   - This data is sent to an MQTT topic on the server. 🌐

2. **Attendance Logging**:
   - Students swipe their RFID cards on the MFRC522 reader while boarding the bus. 🪪
   - The ESP32 processes this data and updates the attendance log. 📝

3. **Data Transmission**:
   - The ESP32 sends all data (location, speed, attendance) to the server using the 4G WiFi module. 🚀

4. **Mobile App Integration**:
   - Users subscribe to the MQTT topic to receive real-time bus information. 📡
   - The app displays the current location, speed, and next stop. 🚍

5. **Admin Dashboard**:
   - The admin accesses attendance logs and route details via a server dashboard. 🖥️
